# Problem this app solves:

I’m a pretty boring guy, when I visit restaurants, I don’t like to try new things and just order the dish I like. Often times I forget what I dislike so this is just an app to keep track of what I like/dislike and possibly new dishes I’d like to try if i’m feeling adventurous. I decided to call it Foodr, after the popular ruby book by Sandi Metz POODR (Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby)
